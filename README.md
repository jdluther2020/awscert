# [AWS Certification Exam Center](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/)

I created this site to provide one comprehensive place for everything AWS Certification related, covering all 11 certifications offered by Amazon as of June 2021. Whether you are beginning your AWS Certification journey or in the middle of it, this site will save a ton of your time generally spent exploring and organizing contents before the exam. I've also curated the training platforms, whitepapers, blogs and other important resources you need in order to prepare and pass the exam with confidence. I am constantly tweaking the site to keep it updated with the relevant and the latest contents. Rarely you need to venture out of the scope of these resources in order to pass an exam but with that assurance, I do encourage to venture out and use the great resources provided by AWS and the larger AWS community to learn and broaden your knowledge, training and experience. Hope you find these pages useful and visit often to lookup up-to-date information throughout your certification process.
